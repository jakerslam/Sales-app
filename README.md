# Overview

{}
I chose to write this to help me practice answering objections for a sales job. There was a list of objections that my boss gave me so I made it able to read them and generate them for me. Python isn't my sharpest language (that's C++) so it seemed like a good idea to practice. It's just a console program right now but I may improve it later.

# Development Environment

I used visual studio code.

I used py3 and an external name generating API along with that random library to generate things.
# Useful Websites

{Make a list of websites that you found helpful in this project}
* [A site explaining how to write a file list to an array](https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/python/how+to+convert+text+file+to+array+in+python)
* [A site explaining how to generate the names](https://moonbooks.org/Articles/How-to-generate-random-names-first-and-last-names-with-python-/)

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
To add if I work on it more:
* A UI
* If there is a plugin that reads them in realistic audio that'd make a great addition
* Make the AI smarter and change the objections depending on the person generated
* Add a part to put responses to the objection and write them to a file
* A way to fail when "responding" that makes sense# objectionPracicePy
